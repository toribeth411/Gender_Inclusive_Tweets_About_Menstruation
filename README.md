# Gender-Inclusive Language in Tweets about Menstruation

_By: Tori Stiegman_

This capstone started as my final project for STAT 318: Regression Analysis and Statistical Models in Fall of 2021, where my partner Andrea Mock and I, fit a multiple linear regression model to identify public health indicators associated with teen birth rate in Chicago. In my capstone project for my Data Science major, I built upon our work by looking into possible interaction models into more detail, and visualizing the interactions in the best multiple linear regression model. We can compare the first-order model and the model with interactions to better understand the relationships between the different predictors.

## Abstract
Because language and social media play critical roles in shaping society's functions, we must strive to use gender-inclusive language while discussing basic bodily processes to promote gender equality and eradicate gender biases. This project looks at how inclusive Twitter users are while tweeting about menstruation by scraping Twitter for English tweets about menstruation and training four different models (two classification trees and two multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers) on variables such as the text of the tweet, the date it was published and the number of likes it recieved in order to classify a larger corpus of tweets as gender- inclusive or exclusive, or neither. It was found that while about 63% of tweets use neither gender-inclusive nor exclusive language, only about 12.5% of tweets about menstruation use inclusive language. This study may imply that while there is a push to use more inclusive language while talking about periods, much more work needs to be done.
